This project aims to detect pneumonia, which is often caused by an infection caused by bacteria in the alveoli. The study uses flexible and efficient approaches using CNN to predict and recognize whether a patient is infected or not . Pneumonia is a life-threatening disease that occurs in the lungs caused by either a bacterial or viral infection. It can be life-threatening if not treated at the right time, which is why early diagnosis of viral pneumonia is important. Pneumonia kills approximately 700,000 children each year and affects 7% of the global population. A chest X-ray is primarily used to diagnose this disease. In this proposed work, an effective pneumonia detection model is trained on digital X-ray images . This work is a supervised learning approach in which the model predicts the outcome based on the quality of the data set used.The proposed system classifies normal vs. pneumonia. The classification accuracy obtained is 91.04%. Therefore, the proposed study may be useful in faster diagnosis of pneumonia by a pulmonologist .
